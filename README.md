# TicTacToeGUI
Project for CPSC 2150: Software Development Foundations at Clemson University

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game that uses the same implementations as the ExtendedTicTacToe project, except instead of operating through the command line, this uses a Model-View-Controller pattern to operate through a Graphical User Interface. This project is not to be copied or used without my permission.
